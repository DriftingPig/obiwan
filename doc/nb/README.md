# Jupyter notebooks for obiwan
If you have a NERSC account you can run these from [https://jupyter-dev.nersc.gov](https://jupyter-dev.nersc.gov), developmental jupyter servers at NERSC which have access to project, scratch and can have a user specified environment. i.e. you can load your python environment having all obiwan dependencies installed

Stephen Bailey and others put together a wiki, [https://desi.lbl.gov/trac/wiki/Computing/JupyterAtNERSC](https://desi.lbl.gov/trac/wiki/Computing/JupyterAtNERSC), explaing for how to use the dev jupyter servers
