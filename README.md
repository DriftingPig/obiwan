# obiwan
An extension of the legacypipe/Tractor pipeline for the [DECALS, MzLS, and BASS Legacy Surveys](http://legacysurvey.org/dr4/description). This package injects artificial stars and galaxy-targets (ELGs, LRGs, and QSOs) into individual images for uncerstanding imaging systematic for [DESI](https://desi.lbl.gov). It re-runs the legacypipe/Tractor pipeline on the modified images and the resulting _simulated_ Tractor catalogues can be used as a Data Release.
